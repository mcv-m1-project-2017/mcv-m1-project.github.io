	<h1>Master CV - M1  Project</h1>
	<p>To put into practice the algorithms and techniques, the students will work on a concrete project along the course. 
	The aim is to provide an applied knowledge of a broad variety of Computer Vision techniques applied to solve a real-world 
	vision problem. The project goal is to detect specific objects in images, in our case traffic signals, using basic CV 
	techniques such as linear and non-linear filtering segmentation, grouping, template matching, modeling, etc. The knowledge 
	obtained can be used in a wide variety of applications, for instance, quality control, generic object detection, security 
	applications, etc.</p>

	<p>The goal of this project is to apply the basic concepts and techniques to build a system to&nbsp;detect specific objects. 
	In this project we focus on Traffic Signs detection and recognition&nbsp;(TSDR) in images recorded by an on-board vehicle 
	camera. This project is framed in the&nbsp;field of the computer-aided driver assistance, along with obstacle detection, 
	pedestrian&nbsp;detection, parking assistance or lane departure warning, as well as a range of non-visual&nbsp;components 
	like GPS-based vehicle positioning or intelligent route planning. For these&nbsp;reasons, TSDR represents a typical problem 
	where Computer Vision techniques can be&nbsp;successfully applied to obtain automatic results in a real-world problem. The 
	learning&nbsp;objectives for the students are the use of local image features, such as color, contours, etc., to implement 
	a system able to solve the proposed problem. In this way, the students can&nbsp;experience with the problems of designing 
	and evaluating the performance of an object&nbsp;detection system</p>
